# key points

1. folder structure basic
2. react hooks
3. react concilliation

# some pointers

- src <- for source folder it can be named anything

- component file extension can be both js and jsx, it does not matter

- updating normal variable wont update UI

# React hooks

- react hooks : normal js utility functions given by react
- example
  - useState() <- for state variable, triggers react reconcilliation (react fibre which came in react 16 first)
  - useEffect()
